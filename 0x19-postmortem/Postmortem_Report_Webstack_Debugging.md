# Incident Report: 502 Bad Gateway Error

## Overview

On March 15, 2023, at 2:30 PM, users began experiencing a 502 Bad Gateway error while attempting to access our e-commerce website. The server architecture is based on a modern microservices framework, which includes multiple interconnected services.

### Timeline of Events

- **14:30 PST**: Users reported a 502 Bad Gateway error when accessing the website.
- **14:32 PST**: Initial checks confirmed that the web server was operational.
- **14:35 PST**: Investigated the status of the upstream services, discovering that one of the critical microservices was unresponsive.
- **14:40 PST**: Attempted to restart the unresponsive service, but it failed to come back online.
- **14:45 PST**: Reviewed the service logs, which indicated a memory overload issue.
- **14:50 PST**: Increased the memory allocation for the affected service and restarted it.
- **14:55 PST**: The service came back online, but the website was still unresponsive due to caching issues.
- **15:00 PST**: Cleared the cache on the web server to ensure fresh content delivery.
- **15:05 PST**: The website was fully operational, and user access was restored.

### Root Cause and Resolution

The primary cause of the 502 Bad Gateway error was an unresponsive microservice due to memory overload. This issue was exacerbated by outdated caching, which prevented the website from serving users even after the service was restored. By increasing the memory allocation and clearing the cache, we successfully resolved the issue and restored normal operations.

### Corrective and Preventive Measures

- **Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring tools to track service health and resource usage in real-time, allowing for quicker identification of potential issues.
- **Load Testing**: Conduct regular load testing to ensure that services can handle peak traffic without performance degradation.
- **Caching Strategy**: Review and optimize the caching strategy to ensure that stale cache does not impact user experience during service disruptions.

By implementing these measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future and enhance the overall reliability of our services.
